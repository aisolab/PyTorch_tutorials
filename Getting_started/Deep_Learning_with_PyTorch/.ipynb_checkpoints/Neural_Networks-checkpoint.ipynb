    "Neural networks can be constructed using the `torch.nn` package.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Now that you had a glimpse of `autograd`, `nn` depends on `autograd` to define models and differentiate them. An `nn.Module` contains layers, and a method `forward(input)` that returns the `output`.\n",

    "**convnet**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights)\n",
    "* Iterate over a dataset of inputs\n",
    "* Process input through the network\n",
    "* Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)\n",
    "* Propagate gradients back into the networkâ€™s parameters\n",
    "* Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: `weight` `=` `weight` `-` `learning_rate` `*` `gradient`"
