    "This document provides solutions to a variety of use cases regarding the saving and loading of PyTorch models. Feel free to read the whole document, or just skip to the code you need for a desired use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to saving and loading models, there are three core functions to be familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `torch.save`: Saves a serialized object to disk. This function uses Python’s pickle utility for serialization. Models, tensors, and dictionaries of all kinds of objects can be saved using this function.\n",
    "2. `torch.load`: Uses pickle’s unpickling facilities to deserialize pickled object files to memory. This function also facilitates the device to load the data into (see Saving & Loading Model Across Devices).\n",
    "3. `torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict`: Loads a model’s parameter dictionary using a deserialized *state_dict*. For more information on *state_dict*, see What is a *state_dict*?.\n",

    "* link : https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#what-is-a-state-dict\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the learnable parameters (i.e. weights and biases) of an `torch.nn.Module` model are contained in the model’s parameters (accessed with `model.parameters()`). A *state_dict* is simply a Python dictionary object that maps each layer to its parameter tensor. Note that only layers with learnable parameters (convolutional layers, linear layers, etc.) have entries in the model’s *state_dict*. Optimizer objects (`torch.optim`) also have a *state_dict*, which contains information about the optimizer’s state, as well as the hyperparameters used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because *state_dict* objects are Python dictionaries, they can be easily saved, updated, altered, and restored, adding a great deal of modularity to PyTorch models and optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
